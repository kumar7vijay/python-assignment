    "\n",
    "##### 2. Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutable: Operations that modify the object in place can be more efficient since they avoid creating new objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immutable: Operations create new objects, which might involve additional overhead, but can be more predictable and safer in concurrent scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.Aliasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutable: Changes through one reference affect all references to the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immutable: Changes create new objects, so other references remain unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutable: Useful when you need to modify data in place, such as maintaining state or accumulating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immutable: Useful for ensuring data integrity, as their unchangeable nature prevents accidental modifications.\n",
    "\n",
